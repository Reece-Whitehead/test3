    <h1>JavaScript Comments</h1>
    <p>JavaScript comments offer a way to explain JavaScript code, making it easier to understand. They can also help deactivate code while testing different code blocks.</p>

    <h2>Single Line Comments</h2>
    <p>Single line comments begin with //. Any text following // to the end of the line is ignored by JavaScript. Observe the examples below:</p>

    <h3>Example 1:</h3>
    <pre>
      <code>
      // Alter the heading
      document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "Intro Page";
      // Alter the paragraph
      document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "Hello, this is my first paragraph.";
      </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>Example 2:</h3>
    <pre>
      <code>
      let a = 10;     // Declare a, assign it 10
      let b = a + 3;  // Declare b, assign it a + 3
      </code>
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Multi-line Comments</h2>
    <p>Multi-line comments begin with /* and end with */. Any text enclosed within /* and */ is ignored by JavaScript. For example:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
      /*
      The following code will modify
      the heading with id = "myH"
      and the paragraph with id = "myP"
      on the webpage:
      */
      document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "Intro Page";
      document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "Hello, this is my first paragraph.";
      </code>
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Commenting Out Code for Testing</h2>
    <p>Comments can also be used to prevent code from executing, which can be useful for code testing. Adding // at the start of a code line turns that code line into a comment and thus, JavaScript ignores it.</p>

     <h3>Example:</h3>
    <pre>
      <code>
      //document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "Intro Page";
      document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "Hello, this is my first paragraph.";
      </code>
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Comments in formal Documentation</h2>
    <p>While single-line comments are more commonly used, block comments are often included in formal documentation.</p>

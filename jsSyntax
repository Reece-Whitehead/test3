        <h1>JavaScript Syntax</h1>
        <p>The rules governing the construction of JavaScript programs are defined by its syntax. It deals with two types of values: Fixed values (Literals) and Variable values.</p>
        <h2>JavaScript Literals</h2>
        <p>Numbers and text strings are examples of fixed values. Numbers can be with or without decimals such as '10.50' or '1001'. Strings are enclosed within double or single quotes such as "Jane Doe" or 'Jane Doe'.</p>
        
        <h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>Variables are used to store data.</li>
           <li>Variables are declared using keywords: var, let and const.</li>
           <li>The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.</li>
           <li>For example: 
           <code>
            let y;
            y = 6;
           </code></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript Operators</h2>
        <p>JavaScript utilizes arithmetic operators like +, -, *, and / for calculations, and uses an assignment operator (=) for assigning values to variables.
        For example: 
        <code>
        let a, b;a = 5;
        b = 6;
        </code>
        </p>

        <h2>JavaScript Expressions</h2>
        <p>An expression, a combination of values, variables, and operators, evaluates to a single value (e.g., "John " + "Smith" evaluates to "John Smith").</p>

        <h2>JavaScript Keywords</h2>
        <p>JavaScript keywords guide the browser on what actions to take. For instance, using the keyword "let" prompts the browser to create a variable.</p>

        <h2>JavaScript Comments</h2>
        <p>Comments within a JavaScript statement are overlooked, hence not executed. These are recognized by // or /* */.</p>
        
        <h2>JavaScript Identifiers</h2>
        <p>JavaScript identifiers are names used for variables, keywords, and functions. They must start with a letter, dollar sign, or underscore. The succeeding characters may be any of these or digits. JavaScript identifiers are also case sensitive.</p>

        <h2>JavaScript and Camel Case</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, camelCase, starting with a lowercase letter, is the preferred naming convention for variables. For example, firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.</p>

        <h2>JavaScript Character Set</h2>
        <p>JavaScript adopts the Unicode character set, which encompasses nearly all characters, punctuation, and symbols worldwide.</p>
